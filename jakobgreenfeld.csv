Stop wasting time and work on things that serve a purpose,2022-03-25T00:00:00+00:00,http://jakobgreenfeld.com/purpose,"[{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://jakobgreenfeld.com/purpose', 'value': '<p>An incredibly useful filter is to ask yourself: What’s the purpose?</p>\n\n<p>There are really always two parts:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Why am I doing this? What’s in for me?</li>\n  <li>Why would anyone care? What’s in for them? What’s the job that gets done?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I’m currently using these questions to filter my project and content idea lists.</p>\n\n<p>Surprisingly often, there is no clear purpose. And everything that’s not serving a <em>clear</em> purpose gets removed from the list.</p>\n\n<p>This helps me figure out where to put my energy.</p>\n\n<p>Another less obvious benefit is that it allows you to check if you actions are actually aligned with your long term goals. You do this by looking at all the projects and content you created during the past few months and then labeling them depending on the purpose they serve.</p>\n\n<p>This is not a fun exercise. Oftentimes you find that you wasted a lot of time on stuff that has no real place in your <a href=""https://jakobgreenfeld.com/game-plan"">game plan</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s make this a bit more concrete.</p>\n\n<p>For example, what are the different reasons to create content?</p>\n\n<p><strong>It attracts backlinks.</strong></p>\n\n<p>If search traffic is a meaningful part of my game plan, creating content as backlink bait makes sense. However, only a small set of content types has a realistic chance of attracting backlinks.</p>\n\n<p>This is where the second part of the equation comes in.</p>\n\n<p>Why would anyone link to this particular piece of content? Does it provide an authoritative answer to a specific question? (E.g. “How many bitcoin holders are there in the US?”) Is it the best or only resource that explains a specific concept or idea? (E.g. “Unbundling Reddit”) And is there sufficient evidence that anyone actually cares about this question or concept?</p>\n\n<p><strong>It generates traffic.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This includes SEO-optimized content and content optimized for social channels.</p>\n\n<p>Again you need to check if there is sufficient demand and if it is realistic that you will get search traffic any time soon.</p>\n\n<p>For social channels, you need to have a proper understanding of the kinds of content that does well on a specific platform and how you’ll need to position it.</p>\n\n<p>But generating traffic is not a means in itself. You need to have a good reason why you want to generate traffic (grow email list, sell something). Ideally, there is a proper funnel in place.</p>\n\n<p><strong>It generates revenue.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This obviously requires that you put the content behind a paywall and are able to distribute it in some way.</p>\n\n<p>One example would be when you have an existing audience and your content helps them solve a specific painful problem.</p>\n\n<p><strong>It deepens your relationship with your existing audience.</strong></p>\n\n<p>To achieve this you need to share real stories from your life.</p>\n\n<p>And this only makes sense if you actually have an audience and want to deepen your relationship with it. You also need to be aware that content in this bucket only very rarely brings in backlinks or leads to meaningful traffic.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, it also needs to serve a purpose for your audience as well. Unless you already have a deep relationship with your audience or sharing <a href=""https://jakobgreenfeld.com/secrets"">secrets</a> or <a href=""http://founderreads.com"">earned insights</a>, they probably won’t care.</p>\n\n<p><strong>To keep your name top of mind.</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you want to increase your luck surface area, it makes sense to spend energy to make sure your name stays top of mind.</p>\n\n<p>Especially on today’s internet, you’re invisible and quickly forgotten unless you publish <em>something</em> on a regular basis. Moreover, everything you put out there gives people an excuse to reach out to you.</p>\n\n<p>Hence even if you’re just sending out short “postcards” it’ll make it a lot more likely that opportunities find you.</p>\n\n<p>Examples are <a href=""https://twitter.com/jakobgreenfeld/status/1445382702161666050"">building in public on Twitter</a> or sending out a short curated newsletter (e.g. Tim Ferriss’ <a href=""https://go.tim.blog/5-bullet-friday-1/"">Five-Bullet Friday</a>, Shaan Puri’s <a href=""http://shaanpuri.com"">5 Tweets Tuesday</a>, or James Clear’s <a href=""https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1"">3-2-1</a>.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>It helps you think things through.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Sometimes when I’m confused about a specific topic or challenge, I just start writing. This always helps.</p>\n\n<p>However, doing this obviously only makes sense if you actually care about the issue and understand that this is what you’re doing.</p>\n\n<p>And in the best case scenario, you’re able to clean up your writing a bit and then use it to get traffic or send it to your existing audience to keep your name top of mind and deepen your relationship with your readers.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, this is precisely what I’m doing with the text you’re reading right now.</p>\n\n<p>I wrote it to check if what I’m doing actually makes sense. But I’m also sending it to my personal email list since many of my readers appreciate it when I share how I’m approaching a challenge like this.</p>\n\n<p>So let me know if that’s the case with you!</p>'}, {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://jakobgreenfeld.com/feed.xml', 'value': 'This is not a fun exercise.

What worked 6+ months ago will work again today,2022-03-09T00:00:00+00:00,http://jakobgreenfeld.com/6-months-ago,"[{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://jakobgreenfeld.com/6-months-ago', 'value': '<p>Ever wondered how some people are able to bang out viral tweets, essays, or projects all the time?</p>\n\n<p>Here’s their secret.</p>\n\n<p>They study what worked 6+ months ago and then post the same thing again with a little twist.</p>\n\n<p>I know, it’s kind of annoying. On some platforms like Reddit people scream “REPOST!”. But on most, they don’t. Especially, if you don’t post a carbon copy.</p>\n\n<p>People don’t have a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3kTXb0ZIY4"">good memory</a> and at any point there’s a fresh cohort of newbies.</p>\n\n<p>This is why there’s a high chance that what worked a few months again will work again today.</p>\n\n<p>This tactic works in all kinds of context.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to grow your Twitter audience, you simply study what tweets and threads in your niche went viral a few months ago. Then you use this input to brainstorm tweet and thread ideas.</p>\n\n<p>For example, in January 2021 Julian Shapiro <a href=""https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1348001394104537089"">posts</a> a thread on the “lies you’re told about the world” that earned 35k+ likes and was read by millions of people. In November 2021 Aadit Sheth <a href=""https://twitter.com/aaditsh/status/1464626688252432391"">posts</a> a thread on the “lies you were told growing up” and gets 8k+ upvotes. In fact, Aadith was able to grow his account to 150k+ followers using almost exclusively this strategy.  You can usually <a href=""https://twitter.com/search?q=Twitter%20worth%20more%20than%20degree%20min_faves%3A500&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=top"">find</a> the original tweet or thread that inspired his <a href=""https://twitter.com/search?q=(from%3Aaaditsh)%20min_faves%3A500&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=top"">most viral content</a> within a few minutes.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re interested in technical marketing, you can head over to Product Hunt and study what projects ended up at one of the top spots a while back. Then you brainstorm how you can launch something similar.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s an example. My project <a href=""https://whattotweet.com"">What to Tweet</a> went viral on Product Hunt in December 2020. A few months later someone launched the <a href=""https://www.producthunt.com/posts/tweet-ideas"">exact same thing</a> and also got hundreds of upvotes.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re interested in content marketing, you study what posts were well received in communities in your niche and then publish something similar. Especially copying successful headlines works really, really well.</p>\n\n<p>For example, my post on “<a href=""https://jakobgreenfeld.com/stay-in-touch"">A simple system I’m using to stay in touch with hundreds of people</a>” that went viral and directed more than 50,000 visitors to my site was (very obviously) inspired by Derek Sivers’ <a href=""https://sive.rs/hundreds"">post</a> on how he stays in touch with hundreds of people.</p>\n\n<p>Now I’m definitely not suggesting you should do this all the time. I personally find it often annoying when people do it and would prefer if people would stick to fresh ideas.</p>\n\n<p>But it’s undeniable that the strategy is working.</p>'}, {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://jakobgreenfeld.com/feed.xml', 'value': 'Ever wondered how some people are able to bang out viral tweets, essays, or projects all the time?'}]"
The unreasonable magic of thinking things through,2022-03-08T00:00:00+00:00,http://jakobgreenfeld.com/game-plan,"[{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://jakobgreenfeld.com/game-plan', 'value': '<p>At the top of my daily todo list I have one big reminder that says “Do things for a reason!”.</p>\n\n<p>It’s the one big thing I want to get better at and hence always keep top of mind when I plan my day. But it feels kind of awkward to admit this.</p>\n\n<p>I mean, what exactly does this say about me?</p>\n\n<p>Well, usually, I’m doing things for no good reason.</p>\n\n<p>That’s a tough realization. My default mode is to just do what feels right without thinking too hard about it.</p>\n\n<p>And to some extent, I’m still convinced that trusting your gut and not overthinking is important. But everything in moderation.</p>\n\n<p>It’s very unlikely that you’ll reach your goal by always going with your gut.</p>\n\n<p>My “awakening” happened after reading the following paragraph in Ray Dalio’s Principles:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Don’t act before thinking. Take the time to come up with a game plan. Take at least a few hours to think through your plan. Those hours will be virtually nothing in relation to the amount of time that will be spent doing, and they will make the doing radically more effective</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It hit me like a brick. The idea is simple, the logic flawless. Why have I never done this?</p>\n\n<p>No one ever taught me the importance of coming up with a game plan. And I certainly never learned how to actually do this.</p>\n\n<p>So let me briefly summarize what I learned since I made it a priority to come up with game plans before rushing into action.</p>\n\n<p>The specifics of course depend heavily on the kind of goals you’re pursuing. But after dozens of experiments, I found that it always boils down to my simple mantra: Do things for a reason.</p>\n\n<p>That’s the magic at the heart of the whole exercise. You start with a clear goal and then write down how you’ll try to achieve it.</p>\n\n<p>Every element of the game plan serves a specific purpose. It’s there for a reason.</p>\n\n<p>Hence, taking the time to come up with a game plan helps you avoid wasting time on tasks that ultimately do not move the needle.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s talk about a specific example.</p>\n\n<p>One of my projects is <a href=""http://undertheradar.io"">Under the Radar</a>. It’s a fairly simple trendspotting service and my goal is to get it to $10k MRR.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve previously struggled to reach this goal because like in any project, there are infinitely many things I could do.</p>\n\n<p>I spent weeks working on new features simply because my gut feeling told me that this might be what users want.</p>\n\n<p>I created a tool users can use to create pretty trend charts. I added a feature that allowed users to request custom trend reports. I added all kinds of trend categories from niche communities to SaaS tools to crypto trends.</p>\n\n<p>I spent even more time trying to automate every single aspect of the service. First I outsourced it and then later replaced the freelancer with machine learning models that automatically classify and select trends.</p>\n\n<p>Did any of these things move the needle? Of course not.</p>\n\n<p>This is obvious if you spent just a few minutes thinking things through.</p>\n\n<p>But I didn’t. And the price I paid was months of wasted time with little to no progress towards my goal.</p>\n\n<p>What could I have done differently?</p>\n\n<p>Here’s how I’m approaching the project now with a proper game plan.</p>\n\n<p>I started by dissecting the project into its elementary building blocks and added all the feature ideas I had on my list.</p>\n\n<p>Then I removed everything that didn’t serve a specific purpose.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=""Game Plan"" src=""http://jakobgreenfeld.com/images/game-plan.png"" /></p>\n\n<p>Good elementary building blocks either bring in traffic (green) or generate revenue (blue).</p>\n\n<p>And of course it’s not enough to just have a vague feeling that something might help to bring in traffic or generate more revenue. There has to be a plausible story for every single block.</p>\n\n<p>For example, the daily updated trend feed is freely accessible and is something people (hopefully) start talking about organically after some initial launch push. If that happens, it’ll also help attract backlinks and hence boost the sites search rankings. The same is true for various simple trend research tools and special collections like “the 100 fastest-growing YC companies by search interest”.</p>\n\n<p>Once this worked, I can start publishing free trend reports focused on keywords people commonly search for. I will then also be able to post summaries of these posts on sites like Reddit to generate more traffic.</p>\n\n<p>Another key element is the free newsletter. This will help keep the project top of mind and opens up new channels like referral marketing, or cross-promotions with other newsletters.</p>\n\n<p>Once I’ve generated flow using these elements, I can start adding more friction.</p>\n\n<p>Most importantly, I can use the newsletter to ask subscribers what kind of premium offer they would be most interested in and then focus on that. There are quite a few options:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>I can monetize the trend feed by giving only pro subscribers access to the full database and the newest trends.</li>\n  <li>I can make certain features of the tools (e.g. exact stats) only available to pro subscribers.</li>\n  <li>And I can publish premium deep dive trend reports or offer custom trend reports.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Taken together I have no doubt that some combination of these premium elements will yield convincing offer once I have the necessary flow.</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly I’m planning to use many of the elements I previously built (special collections, research tools) that didn’t move the needle again. However, difference is that now I’m using them in a way so that they serve a clear purpose.</p>\n\n<p>None of this is rocket since. And of course I could and probably am very wrong with some of my assumptions.</p>\n\n<p>That’s why I will revisit my game plan every Sunday to pick the highest leverage tasks for the next week and adjust it based on the real world data I gathered.</p>\n\n<p>But in any case, I have no doubts that the mere act of thinking things through will help me avoid the dumbest mistakes and stay on track.</p>\n\n<p>Entrepreneurship is a game of chance no matter what you do. But there are things you can do to stack the odds in your favor. And taking the time to come up with a game plan is definitely one of them.</p>'}, {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://jakobgreenfeld.com/feed.xml', 'value': 'It’s very unlikely that you’ll reach your goal by always going with your gut.'}]"
Explore vs. Exploit,2022-03-07T00:00:00+00:00,http://jakobgreenfeld.com/explore-vs-exploit,"[{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://jakobgreenfeld.com/explore-vs-exploit', 'value': '<p>A soldier has absolute conviction.</p>\n\n<p>“We’re going to win this war.” “We’ll win this election.” “We’re definitely going to make a billion dollars.”</p>\n\n<p>Soldiers think of intellectual inquiry as a battle and deeply believe that it’s their job to support their side no matter what.</p>\n\n<p>While a scout is also at war, his mindset is kind of the opposite. He believes that it’s his primary job to figure out what’s true. He analyzes the terrain, competition and any other factor that might play a role as objectively as possible.</p>\n\n<p>“After studying the enemies troops, weather, and terrain, I’ve come to the conclusion that we have a 10% chance of winning the battle here.” “Taking all market factors into account, I think we have a 15% chance of succeeding.”</p>\n\n<p>Common lore is that startup founders need to be soldiers. After all 90% of startups fail. Hence without absolute conviction that allows them to power through and inspire their team when things get tough, they’re doomed from the start, right?</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, it’s a <a href=""https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/book-review-the-scout-mindset"">well-documented fact</a> that many of the most successful entrepreneurs are more scout than solider.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Jeff Bezos <a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/4-lessons-from-amazon-ceo-jeff-bezos-that-can-make-you-more-successful-2015-8?r=US&amp;IR=T"">told</a> his investors that “there’s a 70% chance you’re going to lose all your money.”</li>\n  <li>Elon Musk <a href=""https://www.inc.com/erik-sherman/elon-musk-tesla-spacex-success.html"">said</a> that SpaceX had only a 10% chance of success.</li>\n  <li>Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin <a href=""https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/877690786971754496"">emphasized</a> that he’s “never had 100% confidence in cryptocurrency as a sector”.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Okay, let’s stop right here. I mean, who cares how we label these prominent figures? Also isn’t it equally possible to find examples of highly successful founders with a soldier mindset? Steve Jobs with his legendary “reality distortion field” certainly comes to mind.</p>\n\n<p>First of all, I have of course no idea why you’re interested in the soldier-scout-distinction. I only know that there must be a reason since you clicked on the headline and are reading this sentence right now. But what I can do is tell you why I became interested in the soldier-scout-distinction.</p>\n\n<p>Like most entrepreneurs at some point, I was pondering the following question on a regular basis: Should I spend more time working on my $600 MRR project even though it feels like an uphill battle or invest the time to take a step back explore new terrain?</p>\n\n<p>The soldier screams “keep going”, whereas the scout leans towards the second option.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of wasting time with boring caveats, let’s focus on the more interesting question: What’s the right answer in most cases? Who’s more likely to succeed in this situation, the soldier or the scout? When should you explore vs. exploit?</p>\n\n<p>To use an analogy, who’s more likely to find gold: The guy who sticks to one position and keeps digging deeper or a second guy who takes up lots of soil samples?</p>\n\n<p>Like most entrepreneurs I spend far too much time is reading stories about how entrepreneurs more successful than me got to where they are now. And at least when we consider the (obviously far from statistically significant sample) of founders that I studied, the answer is clear: scouts win.</p>\n\n<p>It’s surprisingly difficult to find find examples of founders who stuck for a long time to a project without obvious product-market fit and succeeded nevertheless. Jon Yongfook’s <a href=""https://www.bannerbear.com/journey-to-10k-mrr/"">journey with Bannerbear</a> is one example that comes to mind. However, he only decided to double dow after many, many scout-type experiments.</p>\n\n<p>And there are countless examples of entrepreneurs being stuck for years since they decided to keep fighting an uphill battle. I don’t want to call anyone out but you can easily find many examples by looking at <a href=""https://www.indiehackers.com/products"">Indie Hacker projects</a> generating ~$1k revenue.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, to give just a few examples, we have:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Brian Armstrong, founder of Coinbase, who has a <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=barmstrong&amp;next=5334110&amp;n=31"">long history</a> as a scout before he finally hit gold.</li>\n  <li>Pieter Levels who founded Nomad List and Remote OK during his <a href=""https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/"">12 startups in 12 months experiment</a>.</li>\n  <li>Alex West who spent <a href=""https://www.alexwest.co/two_and_a_half_years"">two and a half years as a scout</a> before he finally found a project that didn’t feel like an uphill battle.</li>\n  <li>Josh Pigford launched <a href=""https://twitter.com/Shpigford/status/1033032915175858176"">countless projects</a> until he made <a href=""http://baremetrics.com/"">Baremetrics.com</a> ($100k+/mo).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Having said that, note that there’s a difference between the scout mindset and shiny object syndrome. Shiny object syndrome means to jump blindly from project to project, whereas the scout mindset is all about avoiding reality distortion and seeing things as they really are.</p>\n\n<p>In our context here, it’s primarily about avoiding sunk cost fallacy. Jumping from project to project <em>is</em> the winning strategy if you carefully evaluated all the evidence and then decided there’s a better opportunity, ignoring the time, energy, and money you invested in the previous project.</p>\n\n<p>The question I’m now trying to ask myself regularly is: If I hadn’t started this project, would it do it again today?</p>\n\n<p>There’s another aspect worth emphasizing. While the scout mindset is helpful when deciding what project to focus on, a soldier’s mindset seems almost mandatory when it comes to the entrepreneurial journey as a whole.</p>\n\n<p>It <a href=""https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1384262339537498113"">takes</a> most entrepreneur many years, and often more than 20 failed experiments before one of their projects starts generating enough revenue on a regular basis to pay for their living expenses.</p>\n\n<p>Unless you have absolute conviction that this whole entrepreneurship thing will eventually work out for you, you’ll probably quit before you hit gold. Any objective analysis will suggest that a regular job is a smarter alternative to the year-long entrepreneurial grind with little to show for it.</p>\n\n<p>So that’s my takeaway after thinking long and hard about the eternal explore vs exploit question: Be a soldier to defend your entrepreneurial journey, but adapt a scout’s mindset to decide what project to work on.</p>'}, {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://jakobgreenfeld.com/feed.xml', 'value': 'We’re definitely going to make a billion dollars.'}]"
Review and Summary of The Setup by Dan Bilzerian,2022-03-04T00:00:00+00:00,http://jakobgreenfeld.com/the-setup-dan-bilzerian,"[{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://jakobgreenfeld.com/the-setup-dan-bilzerian', 'value': '<p>I’m not in Instagram and know little about what’s going on there. So the first time I heard of Dan Bilzerian’s book The Setup was when he was a guest Logan Paul’s podcast which I also had discovered just recently. (YouTube is another ecosystem I know next to nothing about.)</p>\n\n<p>One of my favorite genre are non-fiction stories that allow me to get glimpses into worlds I know nothing about. For example, I loved <a href=""https://getpocket.com/explore/item/the-mysterious-heir-of-extreme-travel"">this recent story</a> that educated me on the existence of a strange community of “extreme travellers”.</p>\n\n<p>So after listening to the pod with Dan, I thought his book would be similar but for the world of Instagram influencers.</p>\n\n<p>Also I think the name The Setup is really cool. It subtly suggests that Dan has figured out something that allows him to succeed and it wasn’t purely accidentally.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, The Setup didn’t really deliver on either of these promises. Overall, it’s a 5/10 for me.</p>\n\n<p>I mean, don’t get me wrong. It’s not a bad book. It’s quite entertaining for the most part.</p>\n\n<p>But it could’ve been so much better.</p>\n\n<p>Dan claims that he wrote the book himself and after reading it I have no doubts this is true. While it’s cool that he tried, he’s just not a good storyteller or particularly clear thinker. With the help of a good ghostwriter or editor, the book could’ve been incredible.</p>\n\n<p>Great writers can turn even the most mundane things or occurrences into incredibly fascinating stories. So with the kind of material Dan has at his hands…</p>\n\n<p>Bad writers, on the other hand, usually turn the most incredibly occurrences into kind of boring stories. And frankly, this is what Dan did.</p>\n\n<p>The only reason why it’s not complete garbage is that Dan’s life story is incredible.</p>\n\n<p>He’s from a rich family but had a kind of troubled childhood since his father went to jail for fraud and he get kicked out from several schools. After high school, he joins the military since he thinks it would be cool to tell people he’s a Navy SEAL.</p>\n\n<p>But he never makes it past basic training. He claims injuries played a big role but he also admits that he wasn’t liked by the instructors.</p>\n\n<p>Then he goes to college where he discovers drugs, girls, and poker. Dan is not a particularly good poker player but quickly learns what really matters is getting into right kind of games.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of playing against the best players, you want to play against the richest players. This is where the real money is made.</p>\n\n<p>Hence he cultivates his image as a rich trust fund kid. Thanks to this image he’s regularly invited to good games. He’s perceived as an entertaining character and other players are not scared of his poker skills.</p>\n\n<p>Now whether he just played the role of a rich trust fund kid or really was one is up for debate. He claims that he made all his money playing poker and in the beginning faked it till he made it. Given his father’s level of wealth this seems very hard to believe. But of course this would make his story much less cool.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, at some point he decides to become famous, creates an Instagram account, hires a photographer, and the rest is history.</p>\n\n<p>At this point the stories become quite repetitive and even Dan himself seems kind of bored by them. They all follow the same pattern: Went there. Did some drugs. Had a few one night stands. Went back home.</p>\n\n<p>But the stories from the first half of the book are quite fun. And one cool idea Dan had was to include comments by people that appear in his stories who confirm that this really happened.</p>\n\n<p>So much for the stories. Let’s talk about the “the setup”.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the name of the book, Dan doesn’t talk much about it. Only in the epilogue he explains briefly: “<em>The setup is strategy, the act of stacking the odds in your favor. Life is a game. Like any game, you must have a good strategy to win. The implementation of that strategy is called the setup, and it paves the road to success.”</em>\xa0</p>\n\n<p>One example from his high school days he gives is that when he stayed in his family’s house in a beach town where they also owned a boat, meeting girls became almost effortless. Most people in such a town are there to have fun and have little else to do. Hence if you mention casually that you’ll go for a cruise on your boat later today most will be happy to join. If your goal is to meet girls, investing in this kind of setup (house in beach town + boat) is a much smarter choice than memorising hundreds of pickup scripts.</p>\n\n<p>Later (even though he doesn’t spell it out explicitly) his setup consists of a house in the Hollywood hills where he hosts poker games and his image as a rich trust fund kid.</p>\n\n<p>But for whatever reason, Dan not even once explains his setup at any point after that. For example, he always only briefly mentions mysterious “promoters” that bring girls to his parties.</p>\n\n<p>Also his Instagram account obviously plays an important role. But he never explains how he got it off the ground and how he operates it.</p>\n\n<p>Now I do think that the general idea of focusing on and investing in your setup is a really solid one. It definitely also applies if you have other goals in life than Dan Bilzerian.</p>\n\n<p>But Dan missed out on a great opportunity to write the definitely book on the topic. Someone else will definitely do it and it’ll be awesome.</p>'}, {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://jakobgreenfeld.com/feed.xml', 'value': 'The setup is strategy, the act of stacking the odds in your favor.'}]"

I need to stop sabotaging myself,2022-02-07T00:00:00+00:00,http://jakobgreenfeld.com/self-sabotage,"[{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://jakobgreenfeld.com/self-sabotage', 'value': '<p>Last week I was on a call with a friend and the many ways he’s sabotaging himself were so painfully obvious.</p>\n\n<p>For example, he’s not asking people to include his project in their blog posts since he doesn’t want to annoy anyone and feels like the project is not quite ready yet.</p>\n\n<p>Or, there’s a beautifully simple playbook that leverages scripted interviews he could use to grow his project. But again, he’s not doing it since he feels like he would offend people by asking everyone the same questions.</p>\n\n<p>You know, these kinds of things.</p>\n\n<p>After the call my head was spinning: <em>What if I’m doing the exact same thing?</em></p>\n\n<p>I know that like most people, I’m very good at coming up with plausible excuses for almost anything I don’t want to do.</p>\n\n<p>And this is of course also what my friend did. He was immediately able to come up with reasons for why he’s not doing these things.</p>\n\n<p>So I sat down and tried to put the spotlight on myself.</p>\n\n<h2 id=""step-1-answering-the-unasked-question"">Step 1: Answering the Unasked Question</h2>\n\n<p>At the top of a blank piece of paper I wrote: <em>How am I sabotaging myself?</em></p>\n\n<p>After 15 minutes the page was already full. There were just so many painfully obvious examples.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>A year ago, a VC fund had invited me to help with their research. But I never joined their Slack after they sent me the link.</li>\n  <li>My days are always 10x better when I’m starting it with a short meditation session and avoid filling my head with others’ voices for the first hour after waking up. But on most days I give in to the urge to check my emails and Twitter immediately after waking up.</li>\n  <li>I know that I should spend more money to grow my projects and start outsourcing so that I can focus on high-leverage tasks. But here I am, reposting stuff I’ve written on Reddit all by myself.</li>\n  <li>A person I’m genuinely looking up to had started to send me emails, offering feedback and advice. And what did I do? I simply stopped replying.</li>\n  <li>I had a project with clear signs of traction. But instead of doubling down, I hopped on to the next project.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The list goes on and on.</p>\n\n<p>Now I, of course, had “good reasons” in each of these cases.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>The VC fund just wanted to exploit me.</li>\n  <li>These emails are urgent.</li>\n  <li>This is what bootstrap entrepreneurs do. Only VC-funded startups waste money on ads.</li>\n  <li>I wanted to write a perfect, thoughtful reply but then eventually it was too late to send any reply at all.</li>\n  <li>The new project seemed like a much better opportunity.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Yes, I know, I know. These are all weak excuses. They are on exactly the same level as the reasons given by my friend.</p>\n\n<p>Okay that feels like a good start. found the unasked question (”<em>How am I sabotaging myself?”)</em> and started to answer it as honestly as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Now it’s time to identify the real obstacle that is blocking my progress.</p>\n\n<h2 id=""step-2-separate-problems-from-symptoms"">Step 2: Separate Problems from Symptoms</h2>\n\n<p>Now it’s time to identify the real obstacle that is blocking my progress.</p>\n\n<p>What stands out when I’m looking at my list is that there’s no clear pattern. The only thing my examples have in common is that I’m doing things that clearly stand in the way of further progress.</p>\n\n<p>So each of these self-sabotaging actions is just a symptom, not the root cause. And to really solve the problem, I need to tackle this root cause, not just fight the symptoms.</p>\n\n<p>For example, when you’re struggling with headaches and low energy, you can of course fight the symptoms by taking ibuprofen and drinking lots of caffeine. But eventually these temporary fixes will stop working and all kinds of unwanted secondary consequences (e.g. stomach cramps)  start popping up.</p>\n\n<p>To really solve the problem once and for all, you need to get to the root of it. In this example, a good place to start would be drinking more water and fixing your posture. At least, that’s what worked for me.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, it took me years to uncover that my headaches and low energy were caused by dehydration and bad posture.</p>\n\n<p>I of course had tried to drink more water and maintain a better posture. But since there was no immediate improvement and my headaches kept coming back, I gave up after a few days.</p>\n\n<p>Another difficulty was that there were actually two root causes, not just one. Hence I had horrible headaches even though I worked on my posture and hence assumed this was not the solution I was looking for.</p>\n\n<p>Only once I committed to drinking 2 liters of water every day and made a conscious effort to fix my posture for several weeks, I was able to solve the problem once and for all.</p>\n\n<p>Now I wake up every morning and feel like I can rip the world apart and only very rarely get headaches.</p>\n\n<p>This was kind of a tangent but it was important for me to reflect on this story as it contains many important lessons for the inner battle I’m starting now.</p>\n\n<p>Most importantly, I’m under no illusion that identifying and solving the root cause of my self-sabotaging behavior will be easy.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, just as I did with my headaches, I did some reading to learn what others have identified as the most common root causes for self-sabotaging behavior. It’s usually a good starting point to assume that statistics apply to you.</p>\n\n<p>As for most search terms nowadays, the Google results for “self sabotage” are a clickbait dumpster fire. But after a few hours of reading I got at least a few ideas that seem like good starting points.</p>\n\n<p>Popular explanations seem to be things like fear of success, fear of failure, fear of rejection, or <a href=""http://www.sebastianmarshall.com/the-million-dollar-question"">fear of loneliness</a>. But to me these seem like symptoms too, not root causes.</p>\n\n<p>The most likely root cause seems to be a lack of self-esteem/self-love. Yes, it feels extremely cringy to write this in a way that only remotely indicates that this might be <em>my</em> problem.</p>\n\n<p>But that’s precisely why there might be some truth to it.</p>\n\n<p>If you have deep issues with your self-esteem, you will subconsciously assume you simply don’t deserve success. Moreover, it’s better to keep your head down as otherwise, the chances that others expose your flaws are much, much higher.</p>\n\n<p>You might have a carefully constructed confident self-image. But if below the surface of your consciousness you’re riddled by self-doubt, you will always fear this image will be shattered as soon as it’s hit by the cold hard light of reality.</p>\n\n<p>For example, I might tell myself that I can achieve anything if only I ever really tried. That’s my confident, conscious self-image.</p>\n\n<p>But if there are deeper issues with my self-esteem my subconsciousness will assume that this is simply not true and hence help protect my self-image. This is why it feels right to self-sabotage.</p>\n\n<p>As long as I never really try, go all in and really test the limits of my ability, my self-image remains safely intact.</p>\n\n<p>This makes a ton of sense to me. I’m able to see how these patterns could’ve entered my mind as a result of my childhood. Obviously this is not the right place to talk about my childhood traumas but suffice to say that I‘m definitely able to connect the dots.</p>\n\n<p>Now here’s the catch. If a lack of self-esteem is the root cause of my self-sabotaging behavior, it has to be on a deeply, deeply subconscious level.</p>\n\n<p>I’m definitely not riddled by self-doubt. At least on any conscious level. My mental baseline is positive and when it swings, it’s only up. In other words, I’m generally in a good mood and don’t experience episodes where I’m consciously doubting myself.</p>\n\n<p>My self-talk is positive and confident and I don’t have to force my thoughts in that direction. I’m not putting on a mask for the outside world.</p>\n\n<p>So what can I do to tackle the root cause?</p>\n\n<h2 id=""step-3-tackle-the-root-cause"">Step 3: Tackle the Root Cause</h2>\n\n<p>First of all, I think that writing what you just read already helped.</p>\n\n<p>Previously, I might have had some vague feeling that something like this is going on. But now after I was able to spell things out in a coherent way, my confidence has reached a level where I’m taking the issue seriously.</p>\n\n<p>The process of writing crystallized the fuzzy ideas I had floating around.</p>\n\n<p>What else can I do?</p>\n\n<p>Right now, I haven’t found the answer yet. But I started to collect ideas and will report back once I’ve tried them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Therapy</strong>. This is the most common recommendation. But it’s also quite vague. There are lots of different types of therapy and for each of them there are dozens of different ways of doing them. I have no doubts that <em>if</em> you can find the right therapist and approach this can work wonders. But that’s a big if.</p>\n\n<p>I have several friends who were definitely worse off after visiting a therapist.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s an analogy. Let’s say you broke your leg as a child and since then you’ve never really been able to run properly. So you go to a doctor and he tells you in order to fix your leg, he has to break it again. Now maybe the guy knows what he’s doing and there’s a good chance you’ll be finally able to run afterward. But it’s also possible that the guy is a quack and you won’t even be able to walk after the surgery.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, many forms of therapy only seem to <a href=""https://twitter.com/TomKealy2/status/1428458296646721540"">tackle</a> surface-level symptoms rather than focusing on the root issues.</p>\n\n<p>So I’m not sure what I’ll do. If I can find the right approach and practitioner, I’d be happy to give it a shot. But I’ll have to do a lot more research first.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Journaling and Debriefings.</strong> I will add the question: “How am I sabotaging myself?” to my weekly reviews and possibly also to my daily evening debriefing.</p>\n\n<p>Simply putting the issue into the spotlight on a regular basis will keep it top of mind and help me monitor if things get better or worse.</p>\n\n<p>I’ll also add the question “<em>Why</em> am I sabotaging myself?” to give myself space to reflect on the internalized beliefs and patterns from my childhood. Like I said, I’m convinced that there’s a lot of value in seeing lingering thoughts being spelled out explicitly.</p>\n\n<p><strong>More Meditation.</strong> I currently already try to meditate every morning. After each session I get into this state where I’m able to observe myself like a third-person observer.</p>\n\n<p>Since self-sabotaging behavior is so painfully obvious to third-person observers, it’s easy to avoid it as long as I’m in this state. And in the rare cases when it happens,  I can simply call it out, label it in my mind, and this makes me stop it.</p>\n\n<p>But currently, I’m not able to maintain this state for a full day. Hence I will add a second and possibly a third meditation session spread out through the day.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Affirmations and Incantations.</strong> These techniques are definitely a bit more esoteric and it’s easy to write them off as new-age nonsense.</p>\n\n<p>But quite a few people I’m looking up to are <a href=""https://twitter.com/heydannymiranda/status/1374754847585665026"">swearing</a> they work. And the downside is very limited. At most I’ll lose a bit of my time.</p>\n\n<p>So I’ll start by spending 5 minutes each morning writing down positive affirmations about myself. The odds that these will eventually trickle down into my subconsciousness seems to me at least not to be zero.</p>\n\n<p>Possibly even more powerful are <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6V75B_K2kM"">incantations</a>. These are affirmations with a physiological component. You use your body and your voice to embody the meaning behind the words. I also want to try those even though this is gonna feel very weird at first.</p>\n\n<h2 id=""closing-thoughts"">Closing Thoughts</h2>\n\n<p>I wrote everything you read just for myself. But I’ve decided to put it (with some minor modifications) online since I believe there’s some value in seeing how someone works his way through a problem like this.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe it inspires you to try something similar.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, that’s it for now. I’ll keep you posted.</p>\n\n<p><em>Jakob</em></p>'}, {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://jakobgreenfeld.com/feed.xml', 'value': 'Each of these self-sabotaging actions is just a symptom, not the root cause.

Playing the entrepreneurial game with cheat codes,2022-02-04T00:00:00+00:00,http://jakobgreenfeld.com/cheat-codes,"[{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://jakobgreenfeld.com/cheat-codes', 'value': '<p>A few years ago, the lines were clear:</p>\n\n<p>You either were an entrepreneur and focused on building your business, or you went down the influencer route and focused on growing your audience.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, there were always examples of people successfully wandering between these worlds.</p>\n\n<p>Some influencers started their own brands instead of hyping other people’s products. And some entrepreneurs became influencers by sharing the lessons that made them successful.</p>\n\n<p>These kinds of leaps only happened once someone reached the highest level of success in one of these areas.</p>\n\n<p>But right now a seismic shift is happening. The wall that divides influencers and entrepreneurs comes tumbling down and a whole new spectrum between these two extremes starts to emerge.</p>\n\n<p>For every ambitious person who wants to carve out their own path, the decision is no longer a binary one between the influencer game and the entrepreneurial game. Now it’s all about where exactly on this spectrum you want to play.</p>\n\n<p>That’s a huge unlock.</p>\n\n<p>In the old days, you either needed to be genius-level talented or get really lucky to be successful.</p>\n\n<p>Unless you were able to amass millions of followers, the pure influencer game did not yield meaningful real-world returns.</p>\n\n<p>The entrepreneurial game on the other hand was extremely difficult to play unless you’re a genius who’s able to dream up ideas with product-market fit (or simply got lucky to stumble upon such an idea).

But this obviously only really works if you have a huge audience.</p>\n\n<p>Players of the Great Online Game also publish content online.

The <a href=""https://jakobgreenfeld.com/build_an_audience"">most common trap</a> is that people lean too far towards the influencer side while doing little else.</p>\n\n<p>Lots of people churn out content just for the sake of it and on the business side of things launch at most a mediocre info product every now and then. Even in the best-case scenario, the outcome is usually underwhelming.</p>\n\n<p>While you might be able to build a decent Twitter following by posting platitudes or rehashing old viral tweets, its quality will be low. You most likely won’t find the kind of people among your followers that could truly move your career and life forward.</p>\n\n<p>So when in doubt, lean towards the entrepreneurial side.

Overcoming limiting scripts through agency expanding experiments,2022-01-28T00:00:00+00:00,http://jakobgreenfeld.com/invisible-scripts,"[{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://jakobgreenfeld.com/invisible-scripts', 'value': '<blockquote>\n  <p>“The mind, once stretched by a new idea, never returns to its original dimensions.” - Ralph Waldo Emerson</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I rediscovered\xa0<a href=""https://milan.cvitkovic.net/writing/things_youre_allowed_to_do/?utm_campaign=The%20Greenfeld%20Letter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter"">this amazing blog post</a>\xa0that lists\xa0<em>“things you’re allowed to do that you thought you couldn’t, or didn’t even know you could.”</em></p>\n\n<p>The cool thing about these ideas is that they’re agency-expanding.</p>\n\n<p>It’s very easy to get stuck in a rut and do things the way you’ve always done them just because you’ve always done them like that.</p>\n\n<p>As children, we learn all kinds of nonsensical patterns through osmosis from our parents. Far too often we don’t reflect on these invisible scripts that drive most of our decisions.</p>\n\n<p>For example, my parents would always park far outside of cities when we were traveling since downtown parking spots tend to be pricey.</p>\n\n<p>So naturally, this is also what I always did.</p>\n\n<p>But one day I was traveling with the parents of my girlfriend at the time, and they never hesitated to spend some money to make their life easier. We went to a restaurant and without blinking an eye they parked in an expensive car park right next to it.</p>\n\n<p>I still remember that I thought how stupid and wasteful this is.</p>\n\n<p>However, after the meal, it was dark, rainy, and I was sleepy from all the great food. And instead of having to walk for 30 minutes, we were able to hop into the car right away. This is when it hit me: This. Is. Amazing!</p>\n\n<p>If you think about it, it makes little sense to choose a far-away parking spot just to save a few dollars. Good parking spots are still pretty cheap in the grand scheme of things. We are talking about maybe 30 dollars for a full day. And in return, you save so much time and energy.</p>\n\n<p>My parents are neither particularly frugal nor poor. They can easily afford better parking spots. Probably the only reason why they always did this is something that\xa0<em>their</em>\xa0parents always did.</p>\n\n<p>Luckily, I’ve since then also convinced them that a good parking spot is a good investment. I did this by simply paying the fees from my own pocket until they realized that this totally makes sense. After all, if even I, as a poor student at the time, could afford it, it’s really a no-brainer for them.</p>\n\n<p>A more recent example would be my\xa0<a href=""https://twitter.com/jakobgreenfeld/status/1483819034273583104?utm_campaign=The%20Greenfeld%20Letter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter"">realization</a>\xa0that throwing a bit more money at a\xa0<a href=""https://twitter.com/jakobgreenfeld/status/1386964840670015491?utm_campaign=The%20Greenfeld%20Letter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter"">technical problem</a>\xa0is almost always the right decision. Especially when we’re talking about something like $10/month.</p>\n\n<p>An interesting lesson hidden in these stories is that you have to try these things to truly understand them and break free from your invisible scripts.</p>\n\n<p>It’s a bit like with new clothes. You can’t really tell if something looks good until you try it on and look at yourself in the mirror.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, you can argue that if you dollarize your time, spending 45 minutes to walk to a cheaper parking spot just to save $10, means you’re valuing your time at less than minimum wage. But this kind of rational argument rarely convinces anyone.</p>\n\n<p>(If you never thought about dollarizing your time,\xa0<a href=""https://programs.clearerthinking.org/what_is_your_time_really_worth_to_you.html?utm_campaign=The%20Greenfeld%20Letter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter#.YfQApi8w3BI"">this tool</a>\xa0is a great place to start.)</p>\n\n<p>It’<em>s</em>\xa0important to remember that thinking in terms of money-time tradeoffs is just one part of the story.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s a very different example: Like most guys, I read\xa0<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game:_Penetrating_the_Secret_Society_of_Pickup_Artists?utm_campaign=The%20Greenfeld%20Letter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter"">The Game by Neil Strauss</a>\xa0in my 20s. There is really just one thing I took away from it: If you want to talk to someone, you can just walk over and say “Hi”.</p>\n\n<p>This sounds so stupidly simple. And yet almost no one does it. It’s really as if everyone is held back by invisible chains.</p>\n\n<p>After reading The Game, I tried it, nothing bad happened, and my life was forever changed.</p>\n\n<p>The Emerson quote from above is really fitting. Once your agency has expanded in this way, there’s no going back.</p>\n\n<p>And just to be clear, I’m not just talking about hitting on girls. For example, as a student, I went to several summer schools and while everyone else was intimidated by the famous lecturers I just walked over and said “Hi”. Turns out that Nobel laureates (just like beautiful girls) are really happy if someone treats them like normal people.</p>\n\n<p>It can also make sense to spend a lot of money (more than you could justify with your meticulously calculated hourly rate) just to feel better or put you into a different state of mind.</p>\n\n<p>This includes purchases like unreasonably expensive perfume, clothes, or haircuts.</p>\n\n<p>More outlandish examples would be renting a nice office (even if you’re a solopreneur), flying first class, or driving to the airport with a rented limo.</p>\n\n<p>I’m not saying these things make sense for everyone. But they definitely can make a lot of sense if you envision yourself as the kind of person who does these things.</p>\n\n<p>This idea is nicely summarized by one of my favorite\xa0<a href=""https://jakobgreenfeld.com/about/?utm_campaign=The%20Greenfeld%20Letter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter"">mantras</a>:\xa0<em>“You need to start living like the person you want to be.”</em></p>\n\n<p>For example, I’m convinced it’s much harder to become successful if you’re living in your parents’ basement and don’t take care of your looks.</p>\n\n<p>The way you dress, treat yourself, and your environment most certainly have an effect on your\xa0<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psycho-Cybernetics?utm_campaign=The%20Greenfeld%20Letter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter"">self-image</a>.</p>\n\n<p>And your self-image will not only affect how you interact with others but also what kind of opportunities you pursue.</p>\n\n<p>If your self-image is that you’re just a random dude sitting in his parents’ basement, you will most likely sabotage yourself. When someone presents you with an amazing offer or you become aware of a great opportunity, you’ll say no or wait too long since you feel like you don’t deserve it or are not ready for it.</p>\n\n<p>But when the same thing happens while you’re looking sharp and sitting in a nice office, it just seems completely normal that this kind of thing happens. So you say yes and pursue better opportunities.</p>\n\n<p>One related data point:\xa0<a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/people-on-higher-floors-of-buildings-tend-to-take-more-risks-1530064860?utm_campaign=The%20Greenfeld%20Letter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter"">People on higher floors of buildings tend to take more risks</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, it definitely affects your self-image how you travel. Someone who travels to an important presentation by taking a smelly bus will not radiate the same level of confidence as someone who travels with a private driver.</p>\n\n<p>Now since agency expansions rarely happen automatically unless you make a conscious effort, I’ve decided to try at least one potentially agency-expanding experiment per week.</p>\n\n<p>I’m still working on my list of experiments, so let me know if you have any suggestions!</p>'}, {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'https://jakobgreenfeld.com/feed.xml', 'value': 'The mind, once stretched by a new idea, never returns to its original dimensions.'}]"
